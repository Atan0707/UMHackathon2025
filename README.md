## üíª Project Architecture

Zakat that have been collected will be stored inside the blockchain via our own API, and will mint a MYR-stablecoin, based on amount collected.

For example; RM100 = 100ZKT

This is the one of the distribution that we called ZakatCredit. User receive a certain amount of Zakat, that can be used with registered merchant. The idea is from MyKasih, where Zakat recipient will have to use their IC to pay for item with creditted money to their IC. Some of the stablecoin will be linked to the recipient to be used at a certain merchant such as Mydin. 

Merchant then can claim back the money from Zakat Negeri, which will then burn the token and removed it from the supply.

For any zakat activities, such as house repairing and food supply, we've created a function to burn or remove the token from circulation, and processes it to fiat, to ensure all the Zakat funds will be tracked in much more transaprent manners.
